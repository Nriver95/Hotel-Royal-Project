# Hotel-Royal-Project
Repository containing all of my django project files for Hotel Royal project

The purpose of this project is to use html, css, and javascript, with django and sql to create a website that links to multiple pages creating a mock business site (in this case a hotel).
The admin user has the ability to create, update, and delete objects found within an app designed to operate a database for products that would be found in the hotel restaurant.
